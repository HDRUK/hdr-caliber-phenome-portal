### Implementation

This study used a routinely collected primary care data from electronic health records from general practices
contributing to Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum database (August 2020 build) in the three
years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and four months after introducing population-wide restrictions (i.e.
‘lockdown’) on 23rd March 2020 (1st January 2017- 12th July 2020) and an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis is used to formally quantify changes in conditions. 

All individuals (aged ≥11 years) with prevalent diagnoses of diabetes mellitus at
the start of each week of follow-up. Individuals contributed to the study
population from the latest of the start of follow-up in the overall population and
the date of their first record indicating a diagnosis of diabetes.
